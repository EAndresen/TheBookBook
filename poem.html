            <h2>Poem</h2>
                <p>Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.</p>
                <p>Poetry has a long history, dating back to the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.</p>
                <p>Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.</p>
                <p>Some poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.</p>

            <h2>A Dream Within A Dream</h2>
                <h3>by Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
                    <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!
                        And, in parting from you now,
                        Thus much let me avow--
                        You are not wrong, who deem
                        That my days have been a dream;
                        Yet if hope has flown away
                        In a night, or in a day,
                        In a vision, or in none,
                        Is it therefore the less gone?
                        All that we see or seem
                        Is but a dream within a dream.</p>
                    <p>I stand amid the roar
                        Of a surf-tormented shore,
                        And I hold within my hand
                        Grains of the golden sand--
                        How few! yet how they creep
                        Through my fingers to the deep,
                        While I weep--while I weep!
                        O God! can I not grasp
                        Them with a tighter clasp?
                        O God! can I not save
                        One from the pitiless wave?
                        Is all that we see or seem
                        But a dream within a dream?</p>

                <h2>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h2>
                    <h3>by Robert Frost</h3>
                        <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.
                            His house is in the village, though;
                            He will not see me stopping here
                            To watch his woods fill up with snow.
                            My little horse must think it queer
                            To stop without a farmhouse near
                            Between the woods and frozen lake
                            The darkest evening of the year.</p>
                        <p>He gives his harness bells a shake
                            To ask if there is some mistake.
                            The only other sound's the sweep
                            Of easy wind and downy flake.
                            The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
                            But I have promises to keep,
                            And miles to go before I sleep,
                            And miles to go before I sleep.</p>

                <h2>Life is fine</h2>
                    <h3>by Langston Hughes</h3>
                        <p>I went down to the river,
                            I set down on the bank.
                            I tried to think but couldn't,
                            So I jumped in and sank.</p>
                        <p>I came up once and hollered!
                            I came up twice and cried!
                            If that water hadn't a-been so cold
                            I might've sunk and died.</p>
                        <p>But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!</p>
                        <p>I took the elevator
                            Sixteen floors above the ground.
                            I thought about my baby
                            And thought I would jump down.</p>
                        <p>I stood there and I hollered!
                            I stood there and I cried!
                            If it hadn't a-been so high
                            I might've jumped and died.</p>
                        <p>But it was High up there! It was high!</p>
                        <p>So since I'm still here livin',
                            I guess I will live on.
                            I could've died for love--
                            But for livin' I was born</p>
                        <p>Though you may hear me holler,
                            And you may see me cry--
                            I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
                            If you gonna see me die.</p>
                        <p>Life is fine! Fine as wine! Life is fine!</p>
